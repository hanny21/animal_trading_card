## Project Criterias
Page resembles card from design prototype.
* The text is italicized for the animal’s interesting fact.
* The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items.
* The dots are removed from the animal's list items.
* Uses border around animal’s name, image, and information (interesting fact, list items, and description).
* Uses border around animal’s information.
* Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information.
* Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side.
* Card should not expand with the browser window).
* The image is 300px wide or the image's width is set to 300px.
* The image’s `alt` is relevant to the animal used.
